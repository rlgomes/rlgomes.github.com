The timetracker tool is now using the online time tracking service toggl as 
the default tracker and will automatically create new projects by the name of 
the activity you've given your current task and file all of those tasks under
the workspace timetracker. You can change the workspace name in your 
configuration file.

Once you've started tracking your tasks you'll be able to open up toggl and see 
some pretty awesome pie charts of where you're spending your time.

Of course it will be nicer to make more interesting charts/graphs once toggl
matures a bit further but for now at least you can use timetracker to really 
figure out where you spend most of your time when you're on your laptop.
