Been working on a time tracking utitliy for a while now and made [timetracker](http://github.com/rlgomes/timetracker) to
basically track what I do on a daily basis on my gnome desktop. From being able
to tell when I'm chatting with a friend to on the web doing social interactions
on facebook or twitter. The application works very well for me and has been 
built so you could easily extend it to monitor your Mac or Windows desktop by 
creating your own *windowmanager* instance. 

The reporting output has also changed significantly from starting with a default
of using the hamster time tracking utility to moving to an the online toggl 
service which can handle the amount of data generated on a daily basis by my 
usage patterns. The hamster applet wasn't designed to handle a few thousand
task changes per day and was really having issues keeping up. I filed a bug 
[here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/hamster-applet/+bug/685001) in 
the hopes that gets fixed in the future. Meanwhile the default tracker is the 
toggl tracker. 

[toggl](http://www.toggl.com) offers a free account for tracking your activities and seems to have a 
simple and clean interface. I still need to figure out exactly how to inject the
tasks into each project/workspace in a way that makes toggl's stats and graphs
interesting to the end user.

If you're interested in trying out [timetracker](http://github.com/rlgomes/timetracker), then start by reading the README 
at the base of the project and it will let you know how to install on linux 
system. For those of you interested in using this on another OS please contact 
me so we can work out how to achieve this.
