Decided to write a quick and short post on using **ipython notebooks** as I
came across this just today and found it to be extremely useful. If you already
used ipython then I think **ipython notebooks** will be super quick to pick up.
The idea behind the **ipython notebooks** is that they're an ipython session in
the browser that you can save and share with others. Then within that session
you can easily edit the existing session so you can undo parts of it that you
didn't want to share and the final product is a clean session of python code
that you were attempting to show someone else how something works.

The nice thing about **ipython notebook** is that if you're already using 
**ipython** then you already have it installed and ready to go:

    > ipython notebook
    ...

The previous command will open your browser on an ipython session and you can 
start writing into the Web UI the same expressions you'd do in **ipython** on 
the command line like so:

    import random
    data = [ random.randint(1,1000) for _ in range(0, 10) ]
    print data

Once you've filled in a slot on the screen you can hit **Ctrl+Enter** or go to
the top and press the play button to have your code intepreted and the result
rendered in the ipytho notebook. For the above you'd have something like so:

Now you can save the above session and share it with a colleague with ease. Just
click on the **File** -> **Download as** and pick your option. You can start to
see just how useful this is when you share your **ipynb** file with another
pythonista and actually share a piece of executable code that can be used to
iterate on an idea within the ipython shell.

For a more interesting example make sure to **pip** install the vincent library
and then have a look at the [vincent session](/images/2014/ipython_notebooks/vincent_session.ipynb)
from within your own **ipython notebook** session by starting that session in a
directory that contains the **ipynb** file. If the previous loading worked
correctly you'll be looking at a similar session to the following one:
