title: delta - human friendly context aware duration parsing library

Recently needed the ability to parse durations from human readable strings that
were also context aware. The context being the date to start your duration
calculation from so that if you started on January 1st 2017 and wanted 2 months
you'd get exactly 31 (number of days in January 2017) + 28 (number of days in
February).  Then if I gave it the context of April 1st I'd get 61 days since
there were two months with 31 days each.

I tried to find an existing library with no luck so I wrote `delta` to take care
of the job and hopefully someone else would find it of use. You can get your
hands on delta easily through [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) like so:

```
pip install delta
```

Once installed you can use it like so:

```python
import delta

from datetime import datetime

print(delta.parse('1 year 2 months and 3 days'))
print(delta.parse('2 months and 3.5 weeks', datetime(2017, 3, 4)))
```

You can see that `delta` allows you to easily include a context or not and when
you don't supply the context it will assume the current date. Another thing you
may have noticed is you can get quite expressive with the duration expressions
being able to do all of the following:

```
1 year 2 months and 3 weeks
2 months, 3 weeks and 12 days
1y 2m 3w 4d
3.5 years and 2.7 days
```

`delta` will handle all of those without any issues.

If you find `delta` useful then head over to the [github](https://github.com/rlgomes/delta)
project and open any issues or contribute a PR for any additional features you'd
like.
