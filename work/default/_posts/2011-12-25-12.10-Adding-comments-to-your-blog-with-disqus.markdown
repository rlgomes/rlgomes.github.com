This is just a quick write up on how easy it is to add comments to your blog or
site with [Disqus](http://disqus.com). You'll need to create an account at
disqus. Once that is done you can go to your dashboard and add a new site for
the specific site you want to track comments on. The last step is to simple
follow the instructions at **Install** section within your new sites admin page.

In my case all I had to add was:

<console>
&lt;div id="disqus_thread"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    /* * * CONFIGURATION VARIABLES: EDIT BEFORE PASTING INTO YOUR WEBPAGE * * */
    // required: replace example with your forum shortname
    var disqus_shortname = 'example';

    /* * * DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE * * */
    (function() {
        var dsq = document.createElement('script');
        dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true;
        dsq.src = 'http://' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';
        (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] ||
         document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);
    })();
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;Please enable JavaScript to view the
&lt;a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript"
&gt;comments powered by Disqus.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;a href="http://disqus.com" class="dsq-brlink"&gt;blog comments powered by
&lt;span class="logo-disqus"&gt;Disqus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</console>

Once I replaced the 'example' disqus shortname with the shortname of my site
everything worked perfectly. The only thing you'll find is that if you have
a static blog with jekyll as I do you won't be able to see the comments on the
static site when you startup jekyll locally with the "jekyll --server" command.
