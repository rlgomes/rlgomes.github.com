If you use eclipse like I do for developing anything form Python scripts to
Android projects you may have noticed that recently your content assist feature
is either really slow or literally freezes up eclipse. Well you're in luck
because the reason its most likely doing this is because of the ADT Plugin that
you're using to do Android development.

So it seems there are a few bugs open on the subject but put simply the content
assist tries to look for the Android source code under each of the Android
folders at *sdk_location/platforms/android-x* (where x is the android level).
When the content assist can't find the *sources* folder then it just goes nuts
and wastes alot of cpu cycles, the easy fix is to create a simple *sources*
folder under each of those *android-x* folders and your content assist will be
back to behaving as usual.

The longer and less easy fix is to download the source for each of those builds
and place it there, but I really don't think the majority of developers care for
all of the source code.
