So I recently decided to get back on the functional programming band wagon and
get re-acquainted with haskell. Haskell is one of very few purely functional
languages that really expresses programming in a very beautiful mathematical
manner. I learnt Haskell early in university and was always fascinated by how
simple and yet powerful the language was.

Of course, shortly after leaving school I found that functional programming
languages were in no way mainstream or being used by software companies at large.
This was of course in 2003 when I finished my masters and things have changed
quite a bit in the past 8 years. In today's programming scene there are a few
functional programming languages that are being used quite extensively. Erlang
and Scala seem to have found mainstream adoption in a few places and even my
beloved Haskell has some usage behind the curtains at Facebook and Google.

Now I haven't touched Haskell in ages but I thought I'd try and relearn Haskell
and be able to write a few simple tools in Haskell. I will be documenting my
progress in the form of a few blog posts and I hope to spike the interest of
others in the language or at least make it easier for myself in the future when
I want to review the language quickly.
