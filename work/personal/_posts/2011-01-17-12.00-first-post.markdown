Just got the blog up and running with Jekyll and thought I'd post a quick note
to see how things look. This is nothing fancy and just makes tracking my time
and interest in projects very easy since adding a new post is creating a simple
text file and checking it in.

Hopefully I will be able to write more on the things I'm currently working on
in terms of technology as well as some of my hobbies which include music and
piano playing. With time I'll make things look a little nicer but I really want
something simple and easy on the eyes.
