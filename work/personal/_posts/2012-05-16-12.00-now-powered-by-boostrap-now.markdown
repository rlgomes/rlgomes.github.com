Finally decided the blog required a more professional and better look & feel to
it and at the same time wanted to learn a bit more about this [**Bootstrap**](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
framework that some engineers at **Twitter** had released.

I started by simply having a look at the available examples in the source code
and the basic templates and was quickly able to get a grasp on how to use this
along with [**Jekyll**](http://jekyllrb.com/) to make my site look way more
professional.

Having spent a total of about 8 hours on the task I am completely satisfied
with the new look and will make further changes in the weeks to come as I
find small visual issues that I haven't already fixed. To get an idea here is
a screenshot of what the site use to look like before using bootstrap:

And now powered by **Bootstrap**:
