    		<div id="post.body"><p>Just got the blog up and running with Jekyll and thought I&#8217;d post a quick note to see how things look. This is nothing fancy and just makes tracking my time and interest in projects very easy since adding a new post is creating a simple text file and checking it in.</p>

<p>Hopefully I will be able to write more on the things I&#8217;m currently working on in terms of technology as well as some of my hobbies which include music and piano playing. With time I&#8217;ll make things look a little nicer but I really want something simple and easy on the eyes.</p></div>
